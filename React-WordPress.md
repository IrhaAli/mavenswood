The journey began with the goal to understand WordPress. What is WordPress? How can you use it? Well to categorize it, WordPress is software that came into existense for the main purpose of managing blog posts. So how can such a specific idea like blogs have such universal applications? Well if you were to see the web applications that exist under WordPress each aspect of it can be described as a post and the post itself can be simple or have pizzazz through plugins. So in all that breaksdown WordPress into two main aspects. Consisting only of posts and being able to accessorize these posts through plugins.

Well that can give an understanding of WordPress but what is React? Why did it come into existence? What is its significance? Well it's a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. Components allow the web application to run more efficiently by avoiding full page refresh upon small changes (for eg. comments being added). Through React each page of the web application can be perceived as a summation of components. Rather than the whole page, each component is dependent on refresh based on the principles set out by React. An example of principle is useState.

So why create a collaboration between React and WordPress? Well many commend WordPress for it's customizability through the many plugins available. In addition, React is applauded for its efficiency through component rendering. So why not have customizability meet efficiency to create a unique app that runs at a good speed.

How exactly did I test out this collaboration? I went on a mission to create a React app that uses WordPress REST API with user signup and login and the ability to create and read posts. It's a very standard idea but it's the foundation of a more developed idea for a hotel booking website.

These are the tnutorials I used to create the web application.
